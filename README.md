# AWS Secure S3 Lab

This project I demonstrated how to secure an Amazon S3 bucket using IAM policies, encryption, and access logging.

## What this lab covers

- Creating S3 buckets
- Enabling default encryption (SSE-S3)
- Enabling server access logging
- Creating IAM least-privilege policies
- Attaching policies to IAM users
- Uploading test objects

## Architecture

Primary bucket → stores objects  
Logs bucket → stores access logs  
IAM policy → restricts S3 permissions  

## Screenshots
See the screenshots folder for proof of configuration.
